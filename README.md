# AI Vocab Journal 🧠✨

A personal Python script that helps you build, organize, and remember new vocabulary using Google’s Generative AI (Gemini). The tool corrects word spellings, fetches simplified meanings, generates short contextual stories, and saves everything neatly for future review.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I often looked up word meanings on Google but forgot them after a few days. I needed a tool to help me **retain** and **revisit** vocabulary easily. This script was a personal project that turned out to be surprisingly effective, so I'm sharing it here now.
